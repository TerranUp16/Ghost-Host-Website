          <h2>Why <em>Ghost Host</em>?</h2>
          <p>
            At <em>Ghost Host</em>, we know what it is like to be a ghost capable of sensing and manipulating radio waves. Like you, we too have used our powers to manipulate Wi-Fi traffic from the living to redirect their web browser to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rick Roll</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we also know Rick Rolling gets old after a few thousand years- despite Rick Astley's pledge that he's, <q>never gonna give you up</q>. At some point in your afterlife, you want to send the living's web traffic to somewhere... more.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ghost Host</em> provides you with the <strong>web hosting</strong> you need to send your haunts on a custom-tailored journey. Do you want to make your victims believe they've been sent back in time? <em>Ghost Host</em> can help you create a living replica of an early 90s website you can direct your haunts to fool them. Or maybe you want to teach your haunts how to play <em>Phasmophobia</em>. Whatever your ideal web browser haunts entail, <em>Ghost Host</em> is here to help you!

            <em>Ghost Host</em> helped me put my <em>Phlappy Phantom</em> game on the web! Before <em>Ghost Host</em>, I had to spend most of my time finding ways to use my powers to hack peoples' computers to get my game installed on them. But now, I can use my powers to redirect the living right to my game in their web browser. Before they even think to question if a malicious program took over their computer, they start playing my game where they get to guide little, flapping me to the finish line! I really love watching the surprise and joy on their faces.

            My haunting had become a little one-dimensional... until I heard about <em>Ghost Host</em>. I really wanted to drive home the feeling that someone has dug deeply into your personal life and is in control of your personal devices. So <em>Ghost Host</em> has helped me make online galleries for each of the families I am currently haunting. I download pictures the families post on social media and upload them to my <em>Ghost Host</em> galleries. Then, when the haunts are using their phones, I redirect them to my <em>Ghost Host</em> gallery for that haunt, and seeing the dread on their faces as they see their own pictures randomly showing-up on their phone... it's priceless.
